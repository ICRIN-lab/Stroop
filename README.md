# Stroop

The Stroop Task is one of the best known psychological experiments named after John Ridley Stroop. The Stroop phenomenon demonstrates that it is difficult to name the ink color of a color word if there is a mismatch between ink color and word. For example, the word GREEN printed in red ink. The wikipedia web site gives a good description of the effect.

Colin MacLeodâ€™s (1991) review article in the influential psychological journal Psychological Bulletin is frequently cited when discussing the effect.

There are many variations on the basic effect using other stimuli than colored words.

It is easier to measure key presses than the time it takes to name a task; therefore, there are "manual" Stroop tasks in which you need to press colored keys.
